Black Magic Probe for Haoyu HyTiny
==================================

This directory supports BMP on the
[Haoyu
HyTiny](https://www.hotmcu.com/stm32f103tb-arm-cortex-m3-development-board-p-222.html?cPath=1_20)
which is a tad more expensive than a blue pill but has a nice form-factor and is well made.

It supports SWDCLK and SWDIO and presumably TRACESWO, although that is untested. The pin assignment
is:
- LED: A1 (built-in LED)
- TX: A2 (debug TX to device under test)
- RX: A3 (debug RX from device under test)
- SWDIO: A4
- SWCLK: A5
- nRESET: A6

The BMP binary can be built using `make PROBE_HOST=hytiny` and needs to be uploaded using another
BMP or STlink. THe DFU code is currently left out.

To hack on the code there is debug support: add `ENABLE_DEBUG=1` to the make command. The debug
output appears on the "debug USB terminal", i.e. the same one where the debug uart to/from the
device under test appears.
